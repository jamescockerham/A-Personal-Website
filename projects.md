# Projects

Things I've shipped (or am shipping):

### Grok 4 Prompt Library  
Massive collection of working Grok 4 prompts for developers. Private repo, 10k+ lines.

### Termux Desktop  
Full Linux desktop environment inside Termux with VNC + custom keybinds.

### This site → Obsidian → GitHub Pages  
Zero-build static site that updates instantly from my phone or desktop.

### cockerh.am domain hacks  
Because who doesn't love a good domain pun?

More coming — I build in public when I remember to write it down.
