# About James

I've been writing code since dial-up was slow.

Currently obsessed with:
- AI that doesn't hallucinate (as much)
- Making Android feel like a real computer
- Static sites that feel dynamic
- Short, clever domains (hence this one)

Tools I live in:
- Obsidian (this entire site is a vault)
- Grok 4 (hi!)
- Termux + Vim
- Cloudflare everything

If you ever see a weird domain or a GitHub repo with 47 stars and 300 forks, it's probably me.
